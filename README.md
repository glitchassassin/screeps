## Deprecation Notice

This code is in a fairly stable state, but active development has been moved to a private repo as combat and other capabilities become more complex. This repository will no longer be updated, but is left for reference in case any of the patterns are useful.

## Basic Usage

For basic usage of the [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter) framework, see that repo.
